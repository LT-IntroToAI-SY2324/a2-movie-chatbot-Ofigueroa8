# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The most difficult part for me was definitely trying to complete the if statement for the '%'. I had certain ideas about how to go about solving the problem but they were too optimistic in doing it all at once instead of breaking it down into two if statements. I thought about different ways to solve the if statement and kept getting stuck that I eventually felt demoralized to actually code it


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
You could probably use the match function by taking a look at the output of the match function and comparing the strings to a movie database to see what is actually being asked for. If, for example, a movie title and year are given as an output, the movie database would look for those specific keywords in order to give a desired output for the question being asked. The match function extracts the keywords for what is being asked.
